				<h2>Naksha</h4>
				<h4>This project refers to a GUI S/W I created back in May '24. Tabular Packet Analyzers like Wireshark, and tcpdump didn't hold a use-case I was looking forward to, essentially to have IP and nslookups, whois information and pre-filtered Packet acknowledgements be visualized over a map, thus earning its name. Naksha works with L2 Frames and L3 IP/ICMP Packets which are extracted from your specified interface. I do infer that this cannot act as a substitution to conventional packet sniffers, but rather as a complement. Yes, you can work with live sniffing, or a packet capture (*.pcap, *.pcapng) files. There is content not yet pushed, please PM for the same since it is in for paper review.</h4>

				<h2>Khoj</h4>
				<h4>Khoj exhibits both, my love for Network Segmentation, and my hate for segmentation faults. I created this recursive DNS Resolver essentially to fix my dependency of going through some privacy constraints that I had, to create a foolproof bypasser for my University's Firewall. This is a 3 stage Resolver which will resolve the IP Address of a provided domain or subdomain URL. It then forwards the request to a remote server if it is blocked by the firewall (the server is part of a different proxy I created), which is spoofed and sent back to my host station. Advert-hosts are looked up and blocked from being sent to the server. This is thread-safe and written in C which I partially regret. Java could have been a better fit but what are weekends for anyway. </h4>

				<h2>Khat</h4>
				<h4>Khat has (as of '24) been the one of the most ambitious projects I have taken up. Khat is a Hindi-based procedural language I created, which is interpreted in C. Ab ye hindi-bindi kya hai? (Now what is this hindi part?). You use semantics such as "ank b 5 hai" which roughly translates to "integer b is 5" from hindi. If statements are used in the "agar/phir" notation, which is: "agar b 5 se badha hai phir..." to denote if an identifier "b" is greater than a number 5. Here, the use of angular brackets to denote comparison operators is allowed. Similarly, Iterations can be used with "Dauhrao" which means to "repeat". Implementation of functions is still a work in progress, and this will probably be continued for the same! I want to play red dead redemption 2.</h4>

				<h2>Divas</h4>
				<h4>Divas is an AMD64 based disassembler I created using capstone engine in C, which would provide information regarding section header tables, hex dumps and andfunction lists for not-stripped accounts of ELF and Windows PE Executables. This was purely experimental and required extensive analysis of understanding how intel's variable length instruction set and their mnemonics are extracted along with a read of assembly memory addressing protocol. ASLR, PIE and relocation was also researched upon however not entirely implemented. This project was the basis for my Github desciption. </h4>
